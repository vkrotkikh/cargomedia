title: Task - Error Page
---

<p>
	The purpose of this task is to create an error page for <a href="http://www.cargomedia.ch">www.cargomedia.ch</a> and to give us an idea of how you approach a front-end / design task..
	The website is a static website using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and is publicly hosted on Github (<a href="https://github.com/cargomedia/cargomedia.github.io">cargomedia.github.io</a>).
	Feel free to look around and get familiar with Github (if not already).
</p>

<h3>Problem Description</h3>
<p>
	First of all, we want to give you as much artistic freedom as possible. Your solution may fit the current design - may also work completely independent.
	Be creative, think 'out of the box', surprise us - the result may be funny, crazy, interactive, artistic or incredibly simple and clean.
	Feel free to make use of all the possibilities of a modern browser - you don't have to worry about compatibility.
	Everything working in latest (even canary) Chrome, FF, Safari, IE is fine.
	Of course you can use code snippets and third party libraries (<em>jquery, three.js, transit, etc.</em>) at your convenience.
</p>
<p>
	Our current solution looks like <a href="/404.html">this</a> - So there is room for improvement.
</p>

	</li>
	<li>Responsive (Mobile First) Design</li>

</ul>
