We had the idea for a hackathon for quite some time now but never had the time and topic to actually do it. But then a few weeks ago we came up with an interesting topic, which could be doable in a few days and more importantly, would be fun. Because we didn’t have experience in organizing  such an event, we decided to do our first hackathon internally instead of public. Since then, we organized a nice place to stay near the french border in Boncourt Jura, packed our mac minis, linux desktops, screens, laptops, beamer, N64, and of course, an appropriate amount of beer. So now we are here on our third day coding, debating, eating, gaming and drinking. The environment is just great, even the weather is perfect: It has not stopped raining since we arrived. After all, perfect conditions for a successful hackathon. Can’t wait for the next one! Here are a few impressions:
